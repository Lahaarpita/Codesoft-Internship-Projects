## How to Play 🎮

1. The program will prompt you to enter either `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
2. After entering your choice, the computer will randomly select one of the three options.
3. The game will display:
   - **Computer’s choice**
   - **Result of the round**: You win, Computer wins, or It's a tie!
4. You’ll be asked if you want to play again. Type `yes` to continue or `no` to end the game.

## Code Explanation 🧩

- **`get_computer_choice()`**: Randomly selects between `"rock"`, `"paper"`, or `"scissors"` for the computer’s choice.
- **`get_user_choice()`**: Prompts the user for input and validates it.
- **`determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice)`**: Compares the user and computer choices, determining the result based on standard game rules.
- **`play_game()`**: Main function to initiate and control the game flow, looping for continuous play until the user decides to quit.
